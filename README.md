# XO Game

This is my first project on GitHub: a simple XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game to play with a friend on the same device.

## Description
- Classic 3x3 XO game
- Play against a friend on the same computer
- Practicing Git and GitHub with this project

## How to Play
1. Each player chooses X or O.
2. Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.
3. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

### Game Board Layout
- Each player, on their turn, will choose a number from 1 to 9 to select a position on the board.  
- The positions are arranged like a phone keypad:
- Player 1 always starts first.
